Face Recognition-Based Attendance System  

🎓Effortless Attendance Management with Face Recognition 
This project is a smart attendance system that leverages **face recognition technology** to streamline the process of marking attendance. It eliminates the need for manual or card-based systems by recognizing individuals' faces with high accuracy.  

🛠️ Features  
- Face Registration: Register individuals' faces with their details.  
- Automated Attendance: Detect and mark attendance in real-time using a webcam or external camera.  
- Data Storage: Store attendance records in a database for future reference.  
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for administrators to manage attendance records.  
- Secure and Reliable: Ensures only authorized users are recognized.  

💡 Technologies Used  
- Python: Core programming language.  
- OpenCV: For real-time face detection and recognition.  
- Dlib/Face Recognition Library: For accurate facial feature extraction.  
- SQLite/MySQL: For attendance record storage.  

🚀 How It Works  
1. Register individuals' faces in the system.  
2. Use a camera to capture live video.  
3. Recognize and verify faces against the registered database.  
4. Mark attendance automatically if a face matches.
